I am a researcher in the Qwen Team, Alibaba Group. I received my doctoral degree in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University.

I am dedicated to **building scalable, generalist AI systems**. Specifically, I am interested in methodologies that can consistently and efficiently improve the intelligence and task-solving abilities of AI systems with increasing compute and data. My current work focuses on advancing the **reasoning capabilities of the Qwen models (e.g., Qwen3, QwQ)** and developing **large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) approaches**. 

My research interests also broadly span model architecture, interpretability, safety, and alignment. Previously, I conducted extensive research on LLMs for social good, with a main focus on building emotional support systems.

You can find my [CV](./cv_chujie_en.pdf) here.

Welcome! I am Chujie Zheng ("Chujie" pronounced similarly to "Cho-Jay"), a fourth-year Ph.D candidate in [CoAI Group](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml/). I am also currently a visiting scholar in [PlusLab](https://vnpeng.net/) at UCLA, fortunately hosted by Prof. [Nanyun (Violet) Peng](https://vnpeng.net/). I received my B.Sc degree from Dept. of Physics, Tsinghua University. You can find my [**CV here** (updated: 05/2024)](./cv_chujie_en.pdf).

**<font color=red>I am on the job market (2025) and looking for industrial research positions and postdocs. Do not¬†hesitate to reach out to me if you think I am a good fit!</font>**

I have a broad research interest in **building trustworthy AI systems**, with the current focus on **<font color=red>LLM alignment</font>** ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16792), [ICLR 2024 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/forum?id=shr9PXz7T0), [ICML 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018)). My ultimate research goal is to **advance and oversee AI systems in a scalable way (with minimal human intervention) and ensure they operate transparently and responsibly**.

Previously, I conducted research on **LLMs for social good**, with a main focus on building LLMs for emotional support ([ACL 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01144), [ACL 2023 Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13047)). I have also built a series of **popular NLP datasets**, including [**ChID**](https://github.com/chujiezheng/ChID-Dataset), [**KDConv**](https://github.com/thu-coai/KdConv), [**ESConv**](https://github.com/thu-coai/Emotional-Support-Conversation), and [**CDConv**](https://github.com/thu-coai/CDConv), and am proud of them stimulating follow-up work!
